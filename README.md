#AutoBuildSample

I am trying to automate builds in Unity -- to have a customized Unity Cloud, as it were. Follow along in my blog at http://ramble.robotclub.ab.ca/2016/08/16/prepwork-for-automated-building/ 

This is a super-simple project, built with Unity 5.3.1p2. It has two scenes, each with a button that takes you to the other scene. That's it so far.
